## Math Puzzle Wiki

I enjoy using mathematical puzzles as a teaching tool. To that end, I have started a collection of my favorite puzzles
(including the one above) on what I'm calling the [Math Puzzle Wiki](http://www.mathpuzzlewiki.com). It is intended
primarily for fellow math teachers as a resource for in class activities and extra credit problems but it might also be
interesting to puzzle enthusiasts. You are welcome to add puzzle or improve ones already there.

## Puzzles in Research

As an example of how math puzzles can become math research, you might be interested in a recent math talk on [counting
liars and truth-tellers](/talks/jmm2012talk.pdf) I presented at the Joint Mathematics Meeting in January 2012\. A
[paper](/papers/CountingKnightsKnaves.pdf) on this topic was recently published in the College Mathematics Journal.
