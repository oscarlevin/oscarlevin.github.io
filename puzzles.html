<h2>Math Puzzle Wiki</h2>

<p>I enjoy using mathematical puzzles as a teaching tool.  To that end, I have started a collection of my favorite puzzles (including the one above) on what I'm calling the <a href="http://www.mathpuzzlewiki.com" target="_blank">Math Puzzle Wiki</a>. It is intended primarily for fellow math teachers as a resource for in class activities and extra credit problems but it might also be interesting to puzzle enthusiasts.  You are welcome to add puzzle or improve ones already there.</p>

<h2>Puzzles in Research</h2>

<p> As an example of how math puzzles can become math research, you might be interested in a recent math talk on <a href="talks/jmm2012talk.pdf">counting liars and truth-tellers</a> I presented at the Joint Mathematics Meeting in January 2012.  A <a href="papers/CountingKnightsKnaves.pdf">paper</a> on this topic was recently published in the College Mathematics Journal.</p>
